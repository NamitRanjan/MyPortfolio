## Professional Summary

Cybersecurity practitioner with hands-on experience designing SOC labs, tuning SIEM detections, automating incident response workflows, and investigating endpoint/network telemetry. I build practical blue-team systems focused on measurable improvements in detection coverage, triage speed, and incident containment.

---

## Core Competencies

- **Security Operations (SOC):** Alert triage, case management, incident escalation, post-incident review.
- **Detection Engineering:** Rule creation and tuning for Sigma/KQL/Splunk SPL, false-positive reduction, ATT&CK mapping.
- **Threat Monitoring:** Endpoint and network telemetry analysis with Defender, Sysmon, Zeek, and Suricata.
- **SOAR & Automation:** Playbook design using Shuffle/TheHive to cut manual response steps.
- **Cloud Security:** Microsoft Azure security fundamentals, cloud-hosted firewall and workload telemetry.

## Featured Projects

### 1) SOC Detection Lab (End-to-End Monitoring Pipeline)
Built a home SOC that ingests host/network logs into SIEM, applies custom detections mapped to MITRE ATT&CK, and supports repeatable alert triage workflows.

**Highlights**
- Centralized telemetry from Windows endpoints and network sensors.
- Implemented ATT&CK-aligned detection logic and triage runbooks.
- Practiced incident handling from alert intake to closure documentation.

### 2) SOAR Automation with TheHive + Shuffle + Wazuh
Designed a security automation pipeline that enriches alerts, creates cases automatically, and triggers response actions for high-confidence detections.

**Highlights**
- Automated repetitive Tier-1 tasks to reduce investigation overhead.
- Linked SIEM alerts to case lifecycle tracking in TheHive.
- Standardized enrichment and containment playbooks.

### 3) Cloud Security Monitoring on Azure with Fortinet
Deployed and monitored cloud security controls in Azure, with emphasis on perimeter security, telemetry visibility, and incident response readiness.

**Highlights**
- Implemented cloud firewall controls and monitored traffic behavior.
- Correlated cloud events with SOC workflows for faster response.
- Documented secure deployment and hardening considerations.

### 4) Endpoint Threat Detection & Response (Defender + Sysmon)
Created endpoint-focused detection and response workflows using Microsoft Defender and Sysmon events to identify suspicious process, script, and persistence behavior.

**Highlights**
- Investigated endpoint telemetry for common attacker techniques.
- Built practical analyst playbooks for triage and containment.
- Improved confidence in endpoint incident handling.
