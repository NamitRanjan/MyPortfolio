# Project: Cloud Security Monitoring on Azure (Fortinet)

## Objective
Design and monitor a cloud-native security deployment with strong perimeter control, telemetry visibility, and operational response readiness.

## Environment
- Fortinet virtual firewall deployment in Azure.
- Azure networking and security controls.
- SOC monitoring workflow for cloud-generated events.

## Implementation
1. Deployed and hardened firewall controls in Azure.
2. Configured policy sets for ingress/egress monitoring and segmentation.
3. Reviewed logs for anomalous traffic patterns and policy violations.
4. Mapped cloud security events into incident workflow and response process.

## Analyst Deliverables
- Secure architecture notes and deployment guardrails.
- Monitoring checklist for cloud traffic anomalies.
- Incident handling guidance for cloud perimeter alerts.

## Security Outcomes
- Improved cloud traffic visibility.
- Better alignment between cloud controls and SOC operations.
- Reusable baseline for small-team cloud security monitoring.

## Skills Demonstrated
