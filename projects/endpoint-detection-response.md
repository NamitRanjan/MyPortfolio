# Project: Endpoint Threat Detection & Response (Defender + Sysmon)

## Objective
Strengthen endpoint defense by improving detection and triage of suspicious userland behavior and persistence techniques.

## Environment
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
- Sysmon event telemetry.
- Analyst workflow for endpoint investigation.

## Implementation
1. Collected process creation, parent-child relationships, script execution, and persistence events.
2. Investigated suspicious behaviors (encoded PowerShell, unusual scheduled tasks, startup modifications).
3. Created triage logic for severity, confidence, and containment urgency.
4. Documented repeatable response actions for endpoint incidents.

## Analyst Deliverables
- Detection hypotheses with supporting telemetry.
- Endpoint triage checklist and containment guidance.
- Incident records with evidence and lessons learned.

## Security Outcomes
- Improved analyst confidence for endpoint investigations.
- Better signal-to-noise handling in process/script alerts.
- More structured and repeatable endpoint response process.
