# Project: SOAR Automation Pipeline (TheHive + Shuffle + Wazuh)

## Objective
Automate repetitive SOC tasks to improve consistency and reduce manual effort in incident handling.

## Environment
- Wazuh for detection and alert generation.
- TheHive for case management.
- Shuffle for automated playbook orchestration.

## Implementation
1. Integrated alert sources to auto-create cases in TheHive.
2. Built Shuffle workflows for enrichment (IP/domain reputation, context gathering).
3. Added decision logic for response actions based on severity and confidence.
4. Standardized closure workflow with evidence and analyst notes.

## Analyst Deliverables
- SOAR playbooks for triage, enrichment, and response.
- Case templates aligned to SOC workflow stages.
- Alert-to-case mapping strategy for faster investigations.

## Security Outcomes
- Faster triage for repeated alert patterns.
- More consistent analyst decisions through playbook-driven actions.
- Better case quality and auditability.
